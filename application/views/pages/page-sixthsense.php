                    <p>I have a confession to make. </p>
                    <p>Several years ago I hit a crossroads in my life.</p>
                    <p>Like a lot of people I always felt as if there was something lacking.</p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>Some missing puzzle piece that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.</span></p>
                    <p>Take for example, my finances…</p>
                    <p>I did everything right. </p>
                    <p>Went to college, took out more than $100,000 in student loans and worked my butt off. </p>

                    <p><u>But at the age of 28 I had nothing to show for it. </u></p>
                    <p>Back then I worked as a freelance technology journalist. </p>
                    <p>Believe me, this is one of the worst jobs on earth.</p>
                    <p>The main reason is because the mainstream media industry is in serious decline.</p>
                    <p>Because of this I found it harder and harder to get work.</p>
                    <p>Not only that, even when I did have a steady paycheck…well…it wouldn’t last very long.</p>
                    <p>Pretty soon I’d be back to square one…updating my resume and applying for jobs. </p>
                    <p>This made life extremely stressful. </p>
                    <p>I basically lived from job to job…barely making enough money to cover my expenses and rent. </p>
                    <p>I lived in a tiny shoebox apartment and was charged a fortune by my greedy landlord. </p>
                    <p>Even worse was that I couldn’t actually do anything. </p>
                    <p>I had no money for things like going out with friends…or travel…or buying the things that I wanted and needed.</p>
                    <p>For example, I couldn’t even afford a car.</p>
                    <p>I spent almost all of my money paying rent and trying to reduce my student loans.</p>
                    <p>I was literally drowning in debt. </p>
                    <p>And even though I paid my bills on time the amount I owed only seemed to grow. </p>
                    <p>Saving for things like retirement or medical bills was a pipe dream. </p>

                    <p>My love life wasn’t any better.</p>
                    <p>Meeting someone was almost impossible.</p>
                    <p>I’d spend my night at home watching TV, worrying about the future.</p>
                    <p>How was I going to find a girlfriend?</p>
                    <p>Let alone get married and start a family.</p>
                    <p>As time went by my hopes of a better life started to fade.</p>
                    <p>Thinking about the future actually made me terrified.</p>
                    <p>I couldn’t imagine where I’d be in 10, 20, or even 30 years from now. </p>
                    <p>How was I going to retire? </p>
                    <p>Would I be able to start a family some day? </p>
                    <p>The truth was I had no answer for those questions.</p>
                    <p>And this kept me up all night…</p>
                    <p>I’d lie awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering what I was doing with my life. </p>
                    <p>Was I put on earth simply to slave away and work for someone else? </p>
                    <p>Would I ever be financially secure or have all of the things that I wanted? </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>The truth was that life was only getting more and more difficult…</span></p>
                    <p>…and I was becoming more and more desperate for a way out. </p>
                    <p>All I really wanted was for this pain to end. </p>
                    <p>And this brings me back to the confession I talked about earlier. </p>
                    <p>It was a rainy morning in November and I was feeling more stressed out than ever. </p>
                    <p>I was standing on a platform, waiting for the train to arrive. </p>

                    <p>It would be so easy. </p>
                    <p>Then, all of a sudden my phone rang.</p>
                    <p>It was a call from a magazine I’d written stories for a while back. </p>
                    <p>The editor wanted me to write an article about the connection between tech billionaires and spirituality.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, he wanted me to write an article about the Kainchi Dham ashram in India. </p>
                    <p>Because here’s what most people don’t know.</p>
                    <p>Many of the world’s most successful tech entrepreneurs credit this ashram for their success.</p>
                    <p class="mt-5">Here’s an example: </p>
                    <p>Did you know that Steve Jobs actually spent several months living at this ashram after graduating from college?</p>
                    <p>Not only that, Mark Zuckerberg did the same thing when he started Facebook.  </p>
                    <p>And believe it or not it was actually Steve Jobs who recommended that he visit this place. </p>
                    <p>Along with this, dozens of other celebrities have made a pilgrimage to the Kainchi Dham ashram. </p>
                    <p>One of these was Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts</p>
                    <p>I sat there listening with fascination as the editor explained all this.</p>
                    <p>But then my heart sank. </p>
                    <p>It turned out there was a catch.</p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>There’s always a catch.</span></p>
                    <p>They wanted me to write this story…but to do that I’d have to travel to the Ashram. </p>
                    <p>That meant going all the way to India.</p>
                    <p>It also meant I’d have to pay for all travel and accommodation expenses.</p>
                    <p>With cost cutting going on everywhere the magazine couldn’t afford those expenses.</p>
                    <p>But if my story was good…they’d pay me a couple of thousand dollars. </p>
                    <p>This way more than I’d ever been paid for any story. </p>
                    <p>The only problem was that I had to get to India, visit the ashram, track down a source, and write something amazing. </p>
                    <p><strong>This was going to be tricky and I didn’t know if I could pull it off. </strong></p>
                    <p>I barely had any money left in my bank account at that time. </p>
                    <p>The only silver lining was that travel to India is cheap…dirt cheap. </p>
                    <p>Despite all this, I was still hesitant about taking the job. </p>
                    <p>To be honest I wasn’t feeling all that excited.</p>
                    <p>I wasn’t really a fan of travel. </p>
                    <p>And I didn’t exactly feel like travelling halfway around the world to write a magazine article. </p>
                    <p>But hey, it was work and I needed money. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>At that moment I also felt a weird intuition. </span></p>
                    <p>It was as if there was a little voice in my head saying <strong><u>YES.</u></strong></p>
                    <p>So I packed my bags and three days later I was flying into New Delhi.</p>
                    <p>I can still remember the first moment that I spotted this city.</p>
                    <p>It’s a sight I’ll never forget.</p>
                    <div class="py-5 text-center">

                    </div>
                    <p>The place was a kaleidoscope of colours, sights, and sounds.</p>
                    <p>After getting out of the airport I took a taxi to my hotel.</p>
                    <p>I checked in and started planning my trip. </p>
                    <p>To get to the Ashram I’d have to take a 12 hour bus ride through dense, thick rainforest. </p>
                    <p>After that I needed to hike up and into the mountains before finally arriving at my destination. </p>
                    <p>While the journey was long I felt excited about this adventure.</p>
                    <p>To be honest, I was glad to be away from my problems at home. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>So, I got into bed and fell into the deepest and most refreshing sleep of my life.</span></p>
                    <p>The next morning I woke up and embarked on my journey.</p>
                    <p>I don’t remember much about that bus trip. </p>
                    <p>I spent most of the time thinking about my life.</p>
                    <p>I reflected on how far I’d come so far and wondered what I’d discover at the ashram.</p>
                    <p>Along with this I reflected on what my editor had told me.  </p>
                    <p>Both Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg had visited this place and lived there for months.</p>
                    <p>Why did they do this and what did they find in those mountains?</p>
                    <p>Was there a secret hidden somewhere?</p>
                    <p>Whatever it was, I knew I had to discover this for myself.</p>
                    <p>At that moment I made a silent vow.</p>
                    <p>I wouldn’t return until I’d uncovered the mystery. </p>
                    <p>No matter what, I was going to get to the bottom of this. </p>
                    <p>At that moment I said a silent prayer.</p>

                    <p>We’d arrived at our destination.</p>
                    <p>I’d slept through the night and it was now early morning. </p>
                    <p>So, I left the bus and began walking up the path which led to the ashram.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to take forever but eventually I was standing in front of the doors. </p>
                    <p>What struck me was that there seemed to be no one around. </p>
                    <p>I didn’t know it back then but this wasn’t unusual. </p>
                    <p>The monks who lived here spent most of their lives meditating or fasting.</p>
                    <p>And this was why I wasn’t likely to see them during the day. </p>
                    <p>What I also noticed about the ashram was how clean and quiet it was.</p>
                    <p>Seriously, you could hear a pin drop.</p>
                    <p>I’d never experienced such a feeling of deep peace and absolute serenity.</p>
                    <p>As I journeyed through the ashram I started wondering where to go first.</p>
                    <p>How was I going to make contact with a source for my story?</p>
                    <p>But it was then that I heard a voice behind me. </p>
                    <p>I turned to face a little old man wearing the robes of a Hindu monk. </p>
                    <p>I introduced myself and so did the monk. </p>
                    <p>I then went on to tell him that I was writing a story about Steve Jobs and his time at the ashram. </p>
                    <p>Did he know anything about this? </p>
                    <p>The monk stared at me with a confused look on his face. </p>
                    <p>He didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. </p>
                    <p>I asked if anyone else could help me. </p>
                    <p>But according to the monk this was unlikely. </p>
                    <p>After all, Steve Jobs visited the ashram more than 40 years ago.</p>
                    <p>It was unlikely that there was anyone around who knew him. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>At that moment my heart sank.</span></p>
                    <p>Was it all for nothing but a waste of time? </p>
                    <p>Had I come this far for nothing? </p>
                    <p>I was crushed to say the least. </p>
                    <p>But I wasn’t prepared to give up. </p>
                    <p>In case you don’t know India is the home of spiritual retreats. </p>
                    <p>People come from all over the world to seek guidance and help with their problems.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-brown">And this ashram was no different.</p>
                    <p>There were dozens and dozens of other people staying here. </p>
                    <p>Most of them were doing yoga or fasting or consulting with spiritual gurus.</p>
                    <p>So I figured it was worth my while to stick around. </p>
                    <p>I’d spend a few more days at the ashram and get some rest. </p>
                    <p>More time in the mountains wouldn’t do me any harm. </p>
                    <p>I could eat good food, meditate, and by the time I went home I’d feel a little better. </p>
                    <p>Besides that, there was still a chance that I might actually find a lead for my story.</p>
                    <p>If I hung around a little longer, maybe I’d find someone to talk to. </p>
                    <p>So I got a room, unpacked my bags and began exploring the ashram.</p>
                    <p>After a little while I found myself in an outside sitting area.</p>
                    <p>It overlooked the valley and the views were incredible. </p>
                    <p>I found a seat, took in the view, and started thinking about what I was going to do next.</p>
                    <p>It was then that I noticed a man sitting a little way down to my left. </p>
                    <p>This guy must have been in his mid-50’s. </p>
                    <p>He was tall, thin, and had a long flowing beard and grey hair which reached all the way down to his neck. </p>
                    <p>Something else I noticed was that he was dressed in the orange robes of a holy man. </p>
                    <p>It was then that the man spoke. </p>
                    <p>He introduced himself as Brother John and asked me a simple but profound question. </p>
                    <p>What troubles you, my child? </p>
                    <p>What do you mean I asked him. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>He replied: <u>“I can see that you’re under an enormous amount of strain.”</u></span></p>
                    <p>When he spoke those words it felt as if a dam inside of me broke. </p>
                    <p>I almost came close to tears. </p>
                    <p>For some reason I started pouring my heart out to him. </p>
                    <p>Over the next hour I talked without stopping while he sat there listening intently. </p>
                    <p>I told him about everything that was going wrong in my life. </p>
                    <p>How I had no money and was struggling to pay my bills and keep up with student loan repayments. </p>
                    <p>How it felt as if life was hopeless and that I couldn’t see any type of future for myself.</p>
                    <p>I finished by telling him about the story I was supposed to be writing. </p>
                    <p>That this was really my last chance to make it as a journalist. </p>
                    <p>That I desperately needed money but had travelled all this way for nothing.</p>
                    <p>The entire time that I spoke he simply sat there and smiled with a benevolent look on his face. </p>
                    <p>And it was then that he beckoned me closer. </p>
                    <p>Are you willing to try something new he asked?</p>
                    <p>What do you mean I said?</p>
                    <p>You’ll see in a minute…but before we begin, you need to have an open mind.</p>
                    <p>Sure thing I told him, thinking that this was some kind of joke. </p>

                    <p>It was actually the latest version now that I recall. </p>
                    <p>He pulled out a small case from beneath his robes and opened it.</p>
                    <p>Inside was a pair of airpods. </p>
                    <p>He handed them over to me.</p>
                    <p>Please put these in, he commanded. </p>
                    <p>I did as he told me. </p>
                    <p>Now sit down, close your eyes and listen. </p>
                    <p>Once again, I followed his instructions.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly I heard strange music coming from the tiny speakers. </p>
                    <p>To this day it would be impossible for me to describe what I was hearing. </p>
                    <p>But what I do know was that a sensation came over my body. </p>
                    <p>It was a feeling of deep peace and relaxation. </p>
                    <p>The deepest that I’d ever know. </p>
                    <p>Almost immediately all of the negative thoughts I’d been having disappeared. </p>
                    <p>Instead they were replaced with a sensation of complete peace and calm. </p>
                    <p>It felt as if I’d been sick and was now healed. </p>
                    <p>After a while the music stopped and I opened my eyes. </p>
                    <p>What was that I asked the man?</p>
                    <p>Well, it’s a long story, he replied.</p>
                    <p>It all goes back to what you told me about Steve Jobs earlier. </p>
                    <p>You see, just like him I was once a spiritual seeker. </p>
                    <p>I actually started my life off as a scientist.</p>
                    <p>Like you I struggled with money and was actually the first person in my family to attend college. </p>
                    <p>At the age of 18 I enrolled in the university of New Delhi. </p>
                    <p>It was there that I studied neuroscience along with a minor in mechanical engineering. </p>
                    <p>After graduating I went into the world. </p>
                    <p>But, like many young people, I was deeply unhappy. </p>
                    <p>I earned almost nothing and my entire life consisted of going to work and coming back home. </p>
                    <p>As time passed I started to seriously wonder if life was even worth it.</p>
                    <p>But it was these feelings that led to my study of spirituality.</p>
                    <p>I started to train myself in the art of mediation and yoga. </p>
                    <p>Over time this spiritual practice increased and I began to feel a deep sense of peace.</p>
                    <p>This was greater than anything else I’d ever felt before.</p>
                    <p>These studies eventually led me to this ashram. </p>
                    <p>I quit my job and started living here full time…devoting myself to the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.</p>
                    <p>But the scientist in me never died. </p>
                    <p>I wanted to know why these spiritual practices had such a profound effect on my life. </p>
                    <p>Why could meditation and yoga completely transform a person’s life? </p>
                    <p>Lucky for me I was a neuroscientist and could study this subject properly. </p>

                                Now, what a lot of people don’t know is that our brains are actually filled with electrical energy.
                            </h3>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>What do you mean I asked him?</p>
                    <p>Well, our brain cells communicate via these electrical impulses. </p>
                    <p>This is going on all the time, even when you’re asleep. </p>
                    <p>What’s interesting is that you can actually measure this with something known as an EEG machine. </p>
                    <p>This is basically a type of cap which fits over your head. </p>
                    <p>It has sensors which measure the level of electrical activity going on inside of your brain.</p>
                    <p>This activity is represented as waves on the machine and also measured in hertz. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, these waves can actually be broken down into four types.</p>
                    <p>These are known as delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves. </p>
                    <p>Each one of these waves plays a different role in how your brain functions. </p>
                    <p>For example, when you’re in a deep sleep your brain produces delta waves.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, when people are in states of deep relaxation, their brains produce theta waves.</p>
                    <p>Finally we have alpha and beta waves.</p>
                    <p>These are associated with states of intellectual activity, focus, alertness, and relaxation. </p>
                    <p>They’re also associated with a heightened level of consciousness. </p>
                    <p>What’s more, this part of your brain can even regulate parts of your body, for example your blood pressure. </p>
                    <p>This is why they say your mind is stronger than your body. </p>
                    <p>But here’s where it all gets interesting…</p>
                    <p>When I attached this machine to the monks in the ashram I discovered something astounding. </p>
                    <p>Before we get to that you need to understand another important concept. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>In neuroscience this is known as coherence.</span></p>
                    <div class="py-5 text-center">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixth-sense-code-image10.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>It’s a tricky concept to explain but I’ll try to make it as simple as possible. </p>
                    <p>The word coherence basically refers to your brain's ability to communicate with itself.</p>
                    <p>You see, your brain can be broken down into different sections. </p>
                    <p>Each of these sections has a different function.</p>
                    <p>For example, some parts of your brain are responsible for your emotions.</p>
                    <p>Others control speech, memory and so on. </p>
                    <p>This is why people who suffer brain damage sometimes end up losing parts of their memory.</p>
                    <p>That happens because the memory part of their brain becomes damaged. </p>
                    <p>But this is also why brain wave coherence is so important. </p>
                    <p>It’s a measure of how effectively two parts of your brain are able to link and unlink.</p>
                    <p>And also share information. </p>
                    <p>If your brain cannot properly communicate with itself, then you’ll never reach your full potential. </p>
                    <p>And this is what I discovered when I studied the brain waves of these monks. </p>
                    <p>Their brains were almost fully coherent.</p>
                    <div class="pt-5 text-center">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixth-sense-code-image11.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center text-brown">In fact, their coherence level was <u class="fw-semibold"><em>almost 10 times</em></u> the level of a normal person.</p>
                    <p>And I discovered something even more astounding. </p>
                    <p>This coherence was especially apparent in their frontal lobe. </p>
                    <p>What you also have to understand is that this is probably the most important part of your brain.</p>
                    <p>The frontal lobe is responsible for a number of different functions. </p>
                    <p>These include things like thinking, emotions, personality, judgment, self-control, muscle control, memory storage and much, much more.</p>
                    <p>What I also discovered was that this state of full coherence happened when the alpha waves were most active. </p>
                    <p>Remember, these waves are mostly associated with feelings of calm and relaxation.</p>
                    <p>They are also associated with enhanced creativity.</p>
                    <p>Plus the ability to rapidly absorb new information as well as come up with new ideas. </p>
                    <p>Some people also associate these waves with mystical states or what some people refer to as manifestation. </p>
                    <p>What I realized then was shocking. </p>
                    <p>The reason why some monks and holy men seemed to possess superhuman powers was simply because their brains operated at a higher level than ordinary humans. </p>
                    <p>This phenomenon actually has a name in neuroscience.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center text-brown fw-bold pb-4">It’s known as frontal alpha coherence.</h2>
                    <p>But there’s also another reason why this is so important.</p>
                    <p>This is the key reason why some people achieve more than others. </p>
                    <p>And also why they earn more money. </p>
                    <p>What you have to understand is that all success really comes down to a simple question.</p>
                    <p>The question is this: </p>
                    <p><em>Why do we do the things we do?</em></p>
                    <p>That might sound simple, but it can have a profound influence on your life. </p>
                    <p>For example, if you’re overweight it’s probably because you eat too much. </p>
                    <p>Yes, some people have medical problems when it comes to their weight. </p>
                    <p>But for most people it’s simply because they overeat. </p>
                    <p>So the question really is this, what influences these peoples choices? </p>
                    <p>If they have a choice between eating a piece of pie and not eating a piece of pie…well…why do they choose to eat? </p>
                    <p>Believe it or not, scientists have actually found a reason for this. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>It all goes back to frontal alpha coherence and something known as the <strong>Go / No-Go response.</strong></span></p>
                    <p>This is basically a psychological test which measures your level of impulsiveness. </p>
                    <p>What it also does is measure your level of inhibitory control. </p>
                    <p>As well as your ability to rapidly cancel motor activity even after ignition. </p>
                    <p>They may sound difficult to understand so here’s a simpler explanation.  </p>

                    <p>Now, what’s interesting is that they’ve done this test on people wearing EEG machines.</p>
                    <p>What they found was staggering. </p>
                    <p>The scientists discovered that people who scored highly on this test…</p>
                    <p>Also had extremely high levels of frontal alpha coherence. </p>

                    <p>The reason why this is so important…is because controlling your impulses is really the secret of success. </p>
                    <p>Remember the cake example we spoke about before.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Well imagine if you had perfect discipline? </em></li>
                        <li><em>What if you never overate ever again?</em></li>
                        <li><em>What if you never slept late?</em></li>
                        <li><em>What if you quit wasting time playing video games and watching YouTube videos?</em></li>
                        <li><em>Or binging on Netflix shows?</em></li>
                        <li><em>What if you could get yourself to exercise every single day without any effort? </em></li>
                        <li><em>What if you could do anything at any time, no matter how difficult it was?</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Not even 1% of people in the world have this type of power. </p>
                    <p>But guess what? </p>
                    <p>This is what separates the rich from the poor. </p>
                    <p>This is why people like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are so successful.</p>
                    <p>If you had this level of discipline then nothing could stand in your way</p>
                    <p>You’d overcome obstacles in your life with almost no effort. </p>
                    <p>You’d literally become a perfect enlightened human being. </p>
                    <p>The man stopped talking and I sat there thinking about everything he’d just said.</p>
                    <p>Then I asked him a question. </p>
                    <p>If all of this is really true, if success is simply a matter of increasing frontal alpha coherence…then why aren’t you rich and successful? </p>
                    <p>At that point Brother John broke into laughter.</p>
                    <p>But I am, he said.</p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>I’m one of the richest men in India!</span></p>
                    <p>What do you mean I asked in amazement?</p>
                    <p>Well, after discovering these amazing facts I wanted to know if any of this had a practical application. </p>
                    <p>Could I train my brain and experience an elevated level of frontal alpha coherence. </p>
                    <p>Could I elevate myself to new heights and power myself to new success.</p>
                    <p>After all, I’d lived in poverty for years, making a pittance as a research scientist. </p>
                    <p>All I wanted to do now was get rich. </p>
                    <p>What’s more I wanted to do it quickly. </p>
                    <p>But this brings me to the next part of my story.</p>
                    <p>And this will really blow your mind. </p>
                    <p>What if I told you that increasing your frontal alpha coherence could be as simple as flipping a light switch. </p>
                    <p>You see, that’s the problem I had at that point. </p>
                    <p>I didn’t actually know how I was going to apply this information. </p>
                    <p>After all, the only way forward that I could see was to meditate and do yoga like a monk. </p>
                    <p>But this would take time. </p>
                    <p>Some monks in the ashram had been there for 10, 20, or even 30 years. </p>
                    <p>I could wait that long. </p>
                    <p>I wanted to find a way to do this in days, not decades. </p>
                    <p>But as it turned out doing this was a lot easier than I thought it would be. </p>
                    <p>The reason why was simple.</p>
                    <p>What most people don’t know is that each of your brain waves has a specific frequency.</p>
                    <p>For example, alpha waves oscillate at between 8-12 hz while beta waves move between 13-30 hz. </p>
                    <p>Now here’s the interesting thing: </p>
                    <div class="py-5 text-center">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixth-sense-code-image13.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>What neuroscientists also discovered is that it’s possible to alter our brain waves simply by listening to these exact same frequencies.</p>
                    <p>If you play a sound wave at the same frequency as alpha your brain will sync up to that.</p>
                    <p>What that means is that your brain will automatically go into the alpha state. </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>But even though I knew this I didn’t know if it would actually work. </span></p>
                    <p>So, I had a musician friend of mine put together a few pieces of music containing these frequencies. </p>
                    <p>I then began a simple routine where I’d wake up in the morning and listen to these audio tracks and meditate for a few minutes. </p>
                    <p>But that wasn’t enough…</p>
                    <p>I needed something that would prove my brain was operating at a higher level.</p>
                    <p>I also wanted something that would make me money. </p>
                    <p>So, I began using my accelerated brain power to learn all about the forex market. </p>
                    <div class="py-5 text-center">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixth-sense-code-image14.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>This only took a few weeks. </p>
                    <p>Pretty soon I was spending my days trading forex. </p>
                    <p>And after starting out with only $50 dollars I was soon able to double and then triple this sum.</p>
                    <p>In less than a year I turned this small amount of money into over a million dollars. </p>
                    <p>And from that point I only became richer and richer… </p>
                    <p>My life changed entirely. </p>
                    <p>I had more money than I knew what to do with. </p>
                    <p>I travelled around the world, bought clothes, cars, and houses. </p>
                    <p>But after a few years of this I became disenchanted. </p>
                    <p>I realized that money wasn’t everything. </p>
                    <p>What was more important to me were my spiritual studies.</p>
                    <p>Brother John then got a strange look in his eyes. </p>
                    <p>I can see that you feel differently, he said. </p>
                    <p>Of course not, I replied.</p>
                    <p>Well maybe that’s why God sent you to me. </p>
                    <p>What do you mean I asked?</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center text-brown fw-bold pb-4">Well, if you’re here at this specific time and place there must be a reason. </h2>
                    <p>And the only reason can be because God brought you here for a specific purpose. </p>
                    <p>Listen, he said, glancing at me with a funny look on his face. </p>
                    <p>I want to continue my experiment. </p>
                    <p>You’re young and struggling and I want to change that. </p>
                    <p>I want to see you live a better life and overcome your problems. </p>
                    <p>So, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to give you the sound waves which I’ve developed. </p>
                    <p>I want you to go home and do exactly as I did. </p>
                    <p>Listen to them every morning and see if anything changes in your life. </p>
                    <p>If something does happen, then report back to me. </p>
                    <p>In addition to that, if this works for you, then I want you to share them with other people. </p>
                    <p>With disbelief I shook his hand and agreed to everything he’d told me. </p>
                    <p>A few days later I was sitting on an airplane going back home. </p>
                    <p>This trip gave me a lot of time to think. </p>
                    <p>Was this all a lie?</p>
                    <p>Had I been duped? </p>
                    <p>Was Brother John making a joke at my expense? </p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>But what I soon discovered was that everything he had told me was real.</span></p>
                    <p>In fact, over the next few weeks my life would go through some unbelievable changes.</p>
                    <p> To start with, as soon as I got back home again I started listening to the audio track that Brother John had given me. </p>
                    <p>I did this religiously and never skipped a day.</p>
                    <p>It was then that something miraculous happened. </p>
                    <p>Only a few hours after getting home I received a phone call from my mother.</p>

                    <p>What’s funny is that I hadn’t spoken to him in over a decade.</p>
                    <p>Despite this, he made me the main beneficiary in his will. </p>
                    <p>I think he must have heard that I was struggling and wanted to help me out.</p>
                    <p>Using this money I was able to pay off most of my student loans. </p>
                    <p>And remember the story I had to write about Steve Jobs?</p>
                    <p>After listening to the audio tracks I came up with an idea for a better story. </p>
                    <p>I immediately got up out of bed and started writing furiously and kept going throughout the night.</p>
                    <p>The next morning I went directly to my editor’s office.</p>
                    <p>I pitched the idea and couldn’t believe it when he accepted the new article.</p>
                    <p>What’s more, he said it was one of the best things he had ever read. </p>
                    <p>Plus he paid me $5,000 cash on the spot. </p>
                    <p>This was the most I’d ever received for a piece of writing. </p>          
                    <h2 class="text-center text-brown fw-bold pb-4">After that things started getting better and better.</h2>
                    <p>I continued listening to Brother John's audio tracks and came up with more and more ideas.</p>
                    <p>Soon I was earning more than people twice my age. </p>
                    <p>And before long I came to the attention of a prestigious newspaper and was offered a six figure job. </p>
                    <p>Not only that, I met a woman who became my girlfriend and we’re now engaged to be married. </p>
                    <p>But despite all of these successes I never forget about the promise I made to Brother John. </p>
                    <p>So I started sharing his audio tracks with a few of my closest friends. </p>
                    <p>One of these was my buddy Ted.</p>
                    <p>Just like me he was struggling to make ends meet and get ahead in his career.</p>
                    <p>Ted worked in technology sales for a big Fortune 500 company. </p>
                    <p>While this might sound like a great job he was actually on the verge of getting fired.</p>
                    <p> This was mostly due to poor sales. </p>
                    <p>So one night I gave him the tracks and told him to listen to them for just a week.</p>
                    <p class="text-highlight"><span>The month after that his sales increased by 500%.</span></p>
                    <p>He also received a hefty bonus and is now head of sales in his territory. </p>
                    <p>Then there was my other friend Samantha, who was a struggling artist. </p>
                    <p>Despite being talented she just couldn’t get ahead. </p>
                    <p>No one would buy her paintings. </p>
                    <p>I gave her the audio tracks and waited to see what would happen. </p>
                    <p>A week later she came to me with a look of amazement on her face. </p>
                    <p>It turned out that she’d created a new painting and sold it almost immediately. </p>
                    <p>The same buyer had commissioned her to make another four artworks. </p>
                    <p>Today she’s a highly successful artist who travels around the world in her spare time. </p>
                    <p>Then there’s my cousin Chelsea. </p>
                    <p>She couldn’t find a man, no matter how hard she tried. </p>
                    <p>Every relationship she got into went nowhere. </p>
                    <p>These men would do nothing but exploit and abuse her.</p>
                    <p>And every time she left she was older and worse off than before.</p>
                    <p> But all of this stopped the instant she started listening to Brother John’s audio tracks.</p>
                    <p> She’s now met the man of her fantasies. </p>
                    <p>She’s connected with this guy on the deepest level possible. </p>
                    <p>And today she’s happily married and expecting her first child. </p>
                    <p>These success stories inspired me to share my gift with even more people. </p>
                    <p>Every day they would come to me with their own stories of success. </p>
                    <p>But I knew that it wasn’t enough. </p>
                    <p>I had to spread this message further and get it into the hands of even more people. </p>
                    <p>The only way that I knew how to do this was through the power of the internet. </p>
                    <p>So I quit my job and started an online publishing company. </p>

                    <p>This isn’t like other techniques or tools that you’ve used before. </p>
                    <p>You don’t have to meditate for hours or write your problems down in a journal. </p>
                    <p>There’s no need to create a vision board or do any work at all. </p>
                    <p>That stuff is a waste of time and doesn’t work anyway. </p>

                    <p>Because I’ve decided to throw in a few free gifts when you place your order for Sixth Sense Code today.</p>
                    <p>Just consider these “bonuses” for taking action today.</p>
                    <p>These are tools that will help you out more on your journey to success and fulfillment. </p>
                    <p>For example, I know that so many people have creative dreams. </p>
                    <p>These are people who want to be artists, writers, or actors.</p>
                    <p>They’re looking for inspiration, motivation and creative ideas.</p>
                    <p>But elevating your mind to a higher level is one of the easiest ways to do this. </p>
                    <p>By tapping into your brain power you can come up with an almost unlimited number of ideas. </p>
                    <p>That’s why I’ve worked closely with Brother John to create <em class="fw-bold">The Creativity Code.</em></p>
                    <div class="text-center py-5">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixthsensecode-gift1-web.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>This is an additional audio that helps to unlock your creative abilities.</p>
                    <p> This audio is extremely valuable to anyone who works in the creative sphere. </p>
                    <p>But it’s also useful for ordinary people. </p>
                    <p>For example, maybe you’ve always dreamt of starting a business, but don’t know how.</p>
                    <p> With this audio you’ll easily come up with infinite ideas for your business. </p>
                    <p>What’s more, the track can also help you with creative problem solving. </p>
                    <p>Who knows, you may even come up with something as brilliant as the iPod or Facebook.</p>
                    <p>But that’s not all…</p>
                    <p>I want to give you another free gift. </p>
                    <p>It seems as if most people today are run down, tired, and suffering from health problems. </p>
                    <p>This includes things like high blood pressure, frequent illnesses, and problems with their weight. </p>
                    <p>We also know that so many of you are dealing with mental health issues like depression and anxiety. </p>
                    <p>What’s funny is that Hindu priests never experience these issues. </p>
                    <p>In fact, they rarely get ill. </p>
                    <p>And if they do they recover quickly. </p>
                    <p>You never hear them complaining about their weight or things like that. </p>
                    <p>A big reason for this is because they have total control over their bodies. </p>
                    <p>And that’s because they live in a permanent state of frontal alpha coherence. </p>
                    <p>So that’s why we’ve created another audio which is designed to supercharge your health.</p>

                    <p>When you listen to <em class="fw-bold">The Clarity Code</em> for just a few minutes every day, you’ll immediately notice a change in how you look and feel. </p>
                    <p>You’ll develop the habits, discipline, and motivation needed to completely change yourself. </p>
                    <p>Whether that’s as simple as losing weight or building muscle. </p>
                    <p>Not only that, any problems you have with depression or mental health issues will vanish overnight. </p>
                    <p>You’ll finally be able to enjoy life instead of living in a permanent state of anxiety. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, I want to give you one more bonus.</p>
                    <p>This is an eBook is called <em class="fw-bold">“The Prosperity Habit Booster”</em></p>
                    <div class="text-center py-5">
                        <img class="description-img rounded" src="/assets/imgs/sixthsense/sixthsensecode-gift3-web.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>You see, here’s what most people don’t understand.</p>
                    <p>Almost all of your success comes down to your habits.</p>
                    <p>Yes, with the right habits you can be rich and successful beyond your wildest dreams.</p>
                    <p>For example, some people have the habit of eating right, saving their money, and going to bed early…</p>
                    <p>…while other people do the exact opposite.</p>
                    <p>But it’s these habits that make all the difference in the world.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, bad habits can be extremely difficult to break.</p>
                    <p>And this is why I’ve written this book.</p>
                    <p>With my help you’ll learn how to fight back against bad habits, stop them from interfering in your life…</p>
                    <p>…and ultimately give them up for good.</p>
                    <p>We’re quickly coming to the end of this presentation. </p>
                    <p>So there’s only one more question left to be answered.</p>
                    <p>Are you ready to experience all of this for yourself? </p>
                    <p>Are you ready to transform your life, elevate your consciousness, and finally start living the life of your dreams?</p>
                    <p>If the answer to all of those questions is yes, then pay attention. </p>
                    <p>You’re about to learn how to get access to the Sixth Sense Code. </p>
                    <p>As I told you before, I eventually quit my job and started an online publishing company.</p>
                    <p> Why did I do this? </p>
                    <p>It’s simply because I wanted to carry on the mission that Brother John had given me.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this company is to spread his work as far and wide as possible. </p>
                    <p>But the only way that I could do that is by putting his work online and using the power of technology to distribute it. </p>
                    <p>By using the internet I can reach tens of millions of people with very little effort.</p>
                    <p> Unfortunately, running this website isn’t cheap. </p>
                    <p>I’m actually earning a lot less money now than I was before. </p>
                    <p>But I’m not concerned about that. </p>
                    <p>The only thing that really matters is carrying out this mission. </p>
                    <p>Helping people transform their lives is a lot more important to me.</p>
                    <p>I’ve received a powerful blessing in my life and now I want to share that with other people. </p>
                    <p>After all, it would be wrong of me to keep this stuff to myself. </p>
                    <p>That’s why I want to spread these tools as far and wide as possible. </p>
                    <p>The point I’m trying to make is that this really isn’t about money.</p>
                    <p>In addition to that, I could make far more by giving it away privately. </p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of people who would love to have access to these secrets. </p>
                    <p>People who want to become as rich as Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. </p>
                    <p>These people would pay at least $10,000 for what I have. </p>
                    <p>Or even $5,000 or $2,000.</p>
                    <p>But I’m not prepared to do this. </p>
                    <p>That’s because I have a spiritual mission which is far more important than any amount of money. </p>
                    <p>A lot of so-called spiritual guru’s would laugh at this. </p>
                    <p>They often sell courses that go for thousands of dollars.</p>
                    <p>All those people care about is buying their next Rolls Royce or private jet.</p>
                    <p>Me, I’m different. </p>
                    <p>What I really need is a small one time donation. </p>
                    <p>That way I can keep my website going and pay my staff.</p>
                    <p>So with that in mind I’m going to ask you to pay $197.</p>
                    <p>But now that I think about it, I could probably come down a little. </p>
                    <p>Just like you, I know what it’s like to struggle financially. </p>
                    <p>To be permanently stressed out and worried about your bills. </p>
                    <p>This is especially true with the way things are right now.</p>
                    <p>Most people can barely afford to feed themselves, let alone spend money on something like this.</p>
                    <p> So with that in mind I’ve decided to lower the price even more. </p>
                    <p>Today, you can get the Sixth Sense Code for only $39.</p>
                    <p>That’s almost a hundred and sixty dollars off of the original price. </p>
                    <p>Along with that you’ll get the two bonus audios for FREE. </p>
                    <p>This includes the Creativity Code and the Clarity Code. </p>
                    <p>With the combined power of these 3 audios your entire life will change. </p>

                    <p>Still here, I see.</p>
                    <p>I don't blame ya. We covered a lot in today’s video and I know you might have some questions.</p>
                    <p>So I’m going to go ahead and answer some of the most commonly asked questions that we get about the <strong>Sixth Sense Code.</strong></p>

                    <div class="d-flex mb-5">
                        <h5 class="fs-30 fw-500 text-brown mr-3">Q:</h5>
                        <div class="ms-3">
                            <p class="fs-24 lh-normal mt-1 mt-md-2 mb-3"><strong><em>I've tried other "wealth attraction" programs based on The Law of Attraction. They didn't work, what makes this one any different?</em></strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-20 lh-2 mb-0">The Sixth Sense Code stands apart, distinct from the well-known "Law of Attraction." This revolutionary approach is rooted in scientific validation, offering a proven method designed to effectively reprogram your mind. By elevating your frontal alpha coherence, it empowers you to enhance decision-making abilities through heightened awareness—an attribute often referred to as the sixth sense.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <p class="fs-24 lh-normal mt-1 mt-md-2 mb-3"><strong><em>I don’t have the patience for meditation. Will this help me?</em></strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-20 lh-2 mb-0">The great thing about the Sixth Sense Code is that there’s no hard work involved. You don’t have to meditate or do any work at all. It’s simply a matter of listening to the audio tracks for a few minutes a day. You can do this while getting ready in the morning, working out, or sitting in a comfy chair. Interestingly, the sixth sense code can also help to improve your patience.</p>

                            <p class="fs-20 lh-2 mb-0">Well every person is different, so the answer isn't the same for everybody. Remarkable transformations have been reported as early as the first day, while some may take months to activate their sixth sense. I recommend using it every day for a full month before getting too worried about it.</p>
